***"Not all those who wonder are lost"***

A former lamberjack, Flash animator, and many more. Long was my journey before I got to Makers Academy - highly selective 12 week intensive coding bootcamp - where I discovered my love for web once more. Now ater 15 years since I've created my first Dreamweaver website, I've became a junior web developer, and even now while you're reading this I'm working to improve my craftsmanship.

Because my goal is to become a Full Stack developer one day, I'm currently looking for employment opportunities that involves working with any web technology BUT I would also be happy to work on an interesting project as I like to challenge myself and contributing my code to create something new always excites me.

### <a name="skills">Skills</a>

- **Diving deep** - I believe That there's always a possibility to expand my knowledge about a process or task that I'm working on. As an Amazons Instructor and a Problem Solver I'm being constantly challanged with lots of different and complexed issues, and that desire to know "everything" helped me resolve them many times.
- **Shapeless like water** - Every work enviroment is different. There are some standardized rules and procedures ( such as STAR ) but at the end of the day it's all about the people. Having a divert career path has thought me how to deal not only with different job but different kinds of people as well. I presonally think that this ability to quickly adopt is one of my greatest assets.
- **6th sense** - Can't really explain this one. It just seems that for some reason I can ( for example ) find a root of a bug faster then the others I'm working with.
