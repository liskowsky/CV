A former lamberjack, Flash animator, and many more. Long was my journey before I got to Makers Academy - highly selective 12 week intensive coding bootcamp - where I discovered my love for web once more. Now ater 15 years since I've created my first Dreamweaver website, I've became a junior web developer, and even now when you're reading this I'm improving my craftsmanship.
